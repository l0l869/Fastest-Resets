# Fastest Resets

A Macro for MCBE Speedrunning that makes reseting easier and faster

## Setup
### [Temporary Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/5vl_HD6E0Oc) 

### Steps

1. Download the latest release, either the .exe version (if you dont have AHK V1 installed but I suggest you get AHK) or the regular .ahk version

2. Unzip and run "1.16.1 Macro(.exe/.ahk)"

3. Install the resource pack to assist the macro

4. Take screenshots of your buttons as your buttons may look different to the examples in the assets folder

5. You can then press Set-up at the World list screen to test that the macro can find all the buttons

6. A Pop-up saying "Success" would appear to indicate you're ready for resetting, otherwise it would abort if failed


## Aditional Info
* Keep the delay at a minimum of 35ms for verification purposes

* Make sure when taking screenshots the buttons aren't highlighed green

* The macro can be used for newer versions of Minecraft but can't garauntee it will work for older versions, remember to redo setup as UI may be different

* AHK2EXE was used to compile into the exe version (hence why the file size is bigger) so windows defender may not like it

* No performance differences between the two versions

* Player coordinates are read through process memory from a pointer with the ClassMem file
