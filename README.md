# Fastest Resets

A Macro for MCBE Speedrunning that makes reseting easier and faster

## Info
* Supported Auto Resetting Versions: 1.2.13 (soon), 1.14.60, 1.16.0.51, 1.16.0.57, 1.16.0.58, 1.16.1, 1.16.10
* The Resource Pack works between versions: 1.14 -> 1.16.10

Since the pack doesn't work pre 1.14, resetting wont be possible on those versions until a newer version of the pack is released.



* Keep the key delay at a minimum of 35ms (or 1000ms/Recording FPS) for verification purposes.

* The autosplitting of the timer as of now works only for 1.16.1, more versions will become available in the future

* Player coordinates are read through process memory from pointers with the ClassMem file
